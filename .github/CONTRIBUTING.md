# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome your interest in contributing to RetroQuest iOS!

There are a couple basic things to know if you are interested in contributing.

## Community Discussion and Approval

Our goal is for RetroQuest iOS to be a lean product, which means that we want new features to be validated by our customers and be rolled out in an experimental fashion.  If a feature is expensive to build and there's a way to validate user desire beforehand, we want to do that.

See the list of issues for currently planned work.

If you don't see anything related to what you want there, open a new issue and fill out our template describing what it is you want to do.  Opening an issue generates discussion from maintainers and community members about the feature.  Approvals are managed through pull requests.

## Contributing Code

### Feature Branches

When contributing code, you will need to make all changes against a new branch.  When the feature is finished, file a pull request to merge that branch back into master.  Assign a maintainer to the pull request to review your changes and merge them in once approved.

Master is the release branch and so it is a protected branch- only maintainers can check in directly to master.

To avoid pull requests getting sent back to you, please follow the below guidelines when you write code for RetroQuest iOS:

* Features should have sensible test coverage (use your best judgment - exceptions are subject to discussion).
* Keep it simple.
* Keep it readable.
* Use as few technologies as possible, and use boring technologies where possible.

## Release

Once a pull request is merged into master, the feature will be deployed to beta users.
